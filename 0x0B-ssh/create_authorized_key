- To create an authorized_keys file on a Linux system, you can follow these steps:

- Generate an SSH key pair on your local computer using the ssh-keygen command1.

-- This will create two files: 

- a public key file (usually named id_rsa.pub)
- and
- a private key file (usually named id_rsa).

- Create the .ssh directory if it doesnâ€™t exist already2:

mkdir ~/.ssh

- Set the correct permissions for the .ssh directory2:

chmod 700 ~/.ssh

- Create the authorized_keys file within the .ssh directory2:

touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

- Add the contents of your public key (id_rsa.pub) to the end of the authorized_keys file1:

echo public_key_string >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

- Replace public_key_string with the output from the 

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub command that you executed on your local system.
